# Objective: 

# 1 - create a webApp based on ABM Stock

data model: _id, quantity, price, product (object), client, active

# A - create a form to edit  the registry of items in stock

  - items should be listed in a table
  - each item should have a Select and a Delete action

# B - Select action should acess data through a GET method by _id and data should be rendered at the forms to editing

# 2 -  webApp should use crudcrud service as ABM interactions 

--------

# Architecture:

Regardless the fact that there is only one page, it was chosen to split the code into layers like pages, methods, events, context, components and utils.

# Styling:

Material UI is used for styling due to its fancy interface =)

# Biggest Challenges:

Material UI is a great library, it provides a lot of possibilities specially to big applications, but 
i never had worked with Datagrid, so i think it was the biggest challenge understanding its structure and potentials.
